            <p style="text-align: center">
              A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.
              <mark><i>"Do you ever get anywhere?"</i></mark> asked with a
              mocking laugh. <mark><i>"Yes,"</i></mark> replied the Tortoise,
              <mark
                ><i>
                  "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race
                  and prove it."
                </i>
              </mark>
              The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the
              Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who
              had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the
              runners off.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center">
              The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel
              very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a
              Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the
              Tortoise should catch up.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align: center">
              The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after
              a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare
              slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the
              Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he
              could not overtake the Tortoise in time.
            </p>

            <h5 style="text-align: center">
              Moral of the stories: The race is not always to the swift.

            <p style="text-align: center">
              A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home
              with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow
              footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself reflected in
              the quiet water as if in a mirror. But the greedy Dog thought he
              saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead
              of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the
              river, only to find himself swimming for dear life to reach the
              shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly
              thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a
              stupid Dog he had been.

              Moral of the stories: It is very foolish to be greedy.

              A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to
              reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw
              close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor
              to a broken spar, the Ant floated safely to shore.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center">
              Soon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with
              a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the
              heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled
              Dove flew to safety in a distant wood.
            </p>
